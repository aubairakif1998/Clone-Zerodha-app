Zerodha App Clone
Introduction
I am currently undertaking an assignment for my cohort classes in the Full Stack Developer Course led by Harkirat Singh.
As part of my learning journey, I've embarked on an ambitious project to create a clone of the Zerodha App. 
This endeavor aims to replicate the essential features of Zerodha, one of the leading stock trading platforms in India, 
focusing on simplicity, efficiency, and user-friendly design. This project serves not only as a testament to my growing skills as a full-stack developer but also as a practical application of the concepts and 
technologies I've learned throughout the course.
